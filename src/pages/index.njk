    <h1>Ho, hi there !</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Julien. I live in Belgium and I write code for a living as well as for fun. I also share my love of
        code with students.

        As you may have guessed, this site is slowly being built during my free time. Please check back later to see
        some improvements...
